  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  def default_url

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:

  version :small do
    process resize_to_fit: [20, 20]
  end

  version :medium do
    process resize_to_fit: [228, 150]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.

  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
